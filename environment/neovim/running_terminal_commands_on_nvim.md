# Running Terminal Commands on Nvim

Running simple commands without having to exit/switch neovim can be convenient. There are several ways to run commands on top of neovim.

1. Add `!` at the start of the command, e.g., `!ls`.
2. Open Terminal Buffer by running `:terminal`.
3. Using `vim.cmd()` also works, however sticking to the first option is simpler.
