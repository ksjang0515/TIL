# Beginning of a long journey

I was today years old, writing TeX documents keeping record of what I have learned.

Searching for neovim clipboard configuration, I stumbled upon a [github repository](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) with a ton of markdown files.

At first, I thought this was some sort of archive, as it resembled arch wiki, soon realized it is recordings of a man's journey.

I knew this was a passage I should follow.

Here I am, Oct 15, 2024, starting my own journey.

# Why bother writing at all?

1. As I encounter more and more concepts, errors, and documents, it is hard to keep track of them all.
1. One of the most frustrating thing to encounter is re-encountering an error which have been solved a long time ago, too long to remember the solution.
1. Having to relearn things as I've forgot them is awful.
1. Writing summaries helps memorizing and gives a deeper understanding, raising questions about things I haven't understood.
